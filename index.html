                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">From the mixture of materials based on algae and mycelium, and with the reinforcement of other organic components, the proposal is to produce an organic thread to be woven manually, based on Japanese handicrafts. This woven yarn comes to life again forming a sculptural organic fabric that moves through space with the help of motors and movement transfer mechanisms.

                        <h5 class="margin-b-50">Algae and mushrooms are living things. A living being is an organism that is born, grows, reproduces and dies. To complete each of these steps, it evolves and maintains a metabolism (that is, it produces energy when it eats or breathes).</h5>

                            <h4 class="margin-t-10">We believe that part of the "bioWeb" research focused on mycelium can grow a lot within Japan. This is because the importance that mushrooms have for Japanese culture is notorious. It probably started with the abundance of his presence in Japan, due to the country's temperate climate and high humidity. Ancient Japanese poems comment on mushrooms being used as an exchange item.
                            </h4>
                            <p class="font-semi-white margin-tb-30">This ancestral relationship allowed Japan to become an expert in mushroom production. About 400 years ago, during the Edo period, a charcoal producer realized that shiitake mushrooms grew in certain types of wood. Thus began the first process of controlled cultivation of mushrooms in Japan. It was a revolution in the country that has gone through time.
                            </p>
                            <p class="font-semi-white margin-tb-30">The proximity, in Tokyo, between the great technological centers and the rural surroundings, with areas of cultivation and maintenance of traditions with nature, favors research in practical and conceptual terms. What we want with "bioWeb" is to learn from local producers a little of the ancient techniques of mushroom cultivation to obtain the mycelium necessary for the construction of our filament. And so, being able to connect cultures, practices and poetics, locally and globally.
